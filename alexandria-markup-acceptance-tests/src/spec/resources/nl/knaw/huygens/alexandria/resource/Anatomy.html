<title>Alexandria: Anatomy of a resource</title>

<body data-desc="Anatomy of a resource">

<div id="resource-anatomy" data-desc="What does a resource look like?" c:execute="clearStorage()">
    When we <code>GET</code> a resource, what does it look like and what is the meaning of the properties?
    Let us assume that:
    <ul>
        <li c:execute="resourceExists(#resId)">
            a (parent) resource exists with uuid: <code c:set="#resId">69f182ac-5c5f-11e5-8745-ef1581a11364</code>
        </li>
        <li c:execute="#subId = hasSubresource(#resId)">
            this resource has a subresource: <code c:echo="#subId"></code>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h:request>When we
        <h:get>/resources/69f182ac-5c5f-11e5-8745-ef1581a11364</h:get>
        we receive
        <h:status>200 OK</h:status>
        and body
        <h:jsonResponse>{
            "resource" : {
            "id" : "$resId",

            "state" : {
            "value" : "CONFIRMED",
            "since" : "{date.beforeNow}"
            },
            "^provenance" : "https://{host}/resources/$resId/provenance",
            "^subresources" : [ "https://{host}/resources/$subId" ]
            } }
        </h:jsonResponse>
    </h:request>
    <ul>
        <li><code>id</code> shows the uuid of this resource</li>
        <li><code>ref</code> shows the external reference of this resource (which is where the actual contents this
            resource refers to can be found)
        </li>
        <li><code>state.value</code> is one of
            <dl class="dl-horizontal">
                <dt>TENTATIVE</dt>
                <dd>the object has just been created, but not confirmed</dd>
                <dt>CONFIRMED</dt>
                <dd>the object has been confirmed and is in full operational order</dd>
                <dt>DELETED</dt>
                <dd>the object is marked as deleted</dd>
            </dl>
        </li>
        <li><code>state.since</code> is the instant at which this resource's state was set to its current value</li>
        <li><code>^provenance</code> contains a link to the provenance object for this resource
            <small>(who-what-when-why was this object created?)</small>
        </li>
        <li><code>^subresources</code> contains a (possibly empty) array of links to resources which are registered as
            being a subresource of this resource (in this case <code c:echo="#subId"></code>).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="alert alert-info sm">
        Subresources do not have a <code>ref</code> field, as they do not refer to an external location.
        Instead, they have a <code>sub</code> field which locates this subresource relative to its parent and a
        <code>^partOf</code> link to that parent resource.
